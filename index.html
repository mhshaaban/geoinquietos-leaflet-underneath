                        What do I mean by "come alive"?
                        In a normal tiled map in Leaflet, the background map is static.
                        You can add vector data on top of a tiled map, and you can interact
                        with it by clicking etc, but the background map is more or less a dead
                        image.

                        Here's a lot of good example: lots of stores, restaurants etc, but I
                        can't know anything about them except for sometimes their names.

                        Still, that image is generated from one of the most impressive geographic
                        databases we have, the OpenStreetMap database. What is shown in those images
                        is just one side of all the information that is stored in the database.

                        For example, here's the data for the restaurant in the centre from OpenStreetMap.
                        On the tiled map, what you can see are these parts [highlight name and geometry]
                        But as you can see, the geographic part is just a part of all the information
                        actually stored. We have address, opening hours, website and lots of other
                        interesting information.

                        When I say making the tiled map "come alive", I mean making those dead, static
                        images explorable, and making this information accessible.

                    <aside class="notes">
                        So, I must confess I didn't come up with this idea entirely by myself. 
                        There's some prior art, let's look at out favourite competitor Google Maps

                        As you can see, Google Maps actually shows points of interest on the map
                        more or less as links, you can hover and you can click them. Clicking
                        brings up a lot of information similar to what I showed you before.

                        The basic problem: image tiles are raster images. They contain
                        colour information, and the only "meaning" in them is the
                        interpretation from our brains, by putting together the pixels.

                        There's nothing to extract for further exploration here.

                        So, we need a way to add information, on global scale, which
                        almost certainly means tiling.

                    <aside class="notes">
                        I feel obliged just to mention UTFGrid, which is a technology
                        to add interactivity to tiled maps. Its more or less raster
                        tiles, where the "pixels" are not colour values, but
                        indexes into an array of features.

                        Since mouse clicks and finger taps are imprecise, UTFGrid
                        tiles can be lower resolution than raster tiles, saving
                        bandwidth.

                        UTFGrid seems to have gone out of style, and even though
                        a lot of tools support it, it's hard to find good UTFGrid
                        sources for OpenStreetMap data.

                        Potentially, UTFGrid could be a solution, but it would
                        involve setting up your own UTFGrid tiles, which make
                        it just too much work (for me).

                        I should also mention OpenStreetMap's Overpass API, which is
                        a fantastic way to query the OpenStreetMap database.

                        It's versatile, but perhaps not aimed for quick client interaction.

                        Something about sending an arbitrary query in a specialised query
                        language to a server just doesn't sit right with me, it doesn't
                        feel entirely 2016.

                        Something that <em>does</em> feel 2016 is Vector Tiles.
                        So yeah, let's try vector tiles!

                        Compared to UTFGrid, you can get easy access (Mapbox),
                        good tooling if you want to roll your own.

            Objective: make more OpenStreetMap data accessible (opening hours, address, website, etc.) - too few maps actually use/present this data, which in turn makes it less likely to be added
            Google Maps: hover features and clicking to get more information
            Tiled maps are static rasters. The pixels are only interpretable in group, by a human - even if we love tiled maps, there’s only so much you can do with it
            UTFGrid - making raster tiles interpretable (sort of)
            Overpass Turbo - possibly too slow in itself
            Vector Tiles to the Rescue - one tile can respond to multiple queries
            Code example
            Flexibility - load entire view (low latency), or load on demand (low bandwidth)
            Perceived performance (multiple requests)
            Limitations: Points
